# Merkle Tree
Implementation of a Merkle tree in Rust.

# Why?

The purpose of this project is to learn about the Merkle Tree, a widely used structure in distributed systems for data verification, while implementing it.

# Implementations

This implementation will support:
- The Merkle Tree can be built out of an array.
- The Merkle Tree can generate a proof that it contains an element.
- The Merkle Tree can verify that a given hash is contained in it.
- The Merkle Tree can be dynamic, this means that elements can be added once it is built.

# Uses

- Rust 1.85.0
